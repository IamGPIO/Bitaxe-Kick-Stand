# Bitaxe-Kick-Stand

These files are offered free of charge.   
The stand has been designed for the awesome Bitaxe Open Source bitcoin miner as developed by Skot9000 and team (https://bitaxe.org/)

There are two versions of the "Kick Stand" file sets.  
The two versions are "With Logo" and "No Logo".  

"With Logo": Recess for a bespoke Bitaxe sticker of which image file is in this repository.  
"No Logo": No recess.  

Note: If you get Bitaxe stickers made for this stand, they must be exactly 29.5mm wide x 12.8mm high.  
 
They have been drawn in Fusion360 by myself (IamGPIO) of www.thesolomining.co  

You will need 4 x (M3 x 6mm) self tapping screws.  


If you can improve this design, feel free to do so. Remember, sharing is caring.  
If this design doesnt work for you, sorry about that.  
If it does, good stuff!
