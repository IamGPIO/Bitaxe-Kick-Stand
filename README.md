# Bitaxe-Kick-Stand

These files are offered free of charge. 
The stand has been designed for the awesome Bitaxe Open Source bitcoin miner as developed by Skot9000 and team (https://bitaxe.org/)

There are two versions "With Logo" and "Without Logo".

"With Logo": Recess for a bespoke Bitaxe sticker of which files are in this repository.  
"No Logo": No recess
 
They have been drawn in Fusion360 by myself (IamGPIO) of www.thesolomining.co

You will need 4 x (M3 x 6mm) self tapping screws.


If you can improve this design, feel free to do so. Rememeber, sharing is caring.
If this design doesnt work for you, sorry about that.
If it does, good stuff!
